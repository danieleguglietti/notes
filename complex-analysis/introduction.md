# Complex Numbers, Complex Functions

Back in the days, mathematicians could relay solely on real numbers. That wasn't quite a big issue, since most of our problems could be solved with real numbers. However, there was a crucial issue that remained unsolved: finding roots for quadratic equations whose discriminant is negative.

An analytical interpretation is that there is _no such **real number** that its square is negative,_ since the second power of every real is non-negative.

For a geometric interpretation, finding roots of a quadratic equation is findings the values of the variable where the parabola associated to the given equation is intersects the x-axis. Additionally, the signature of the discriminant tells how many times the parabola intersects the x-axis: a positive discriminant means two intersection points, a zero discriminant means one intersection point, and a negative discriminant means there are no points of intersection. So equations with negative discriminant have no roots since they never intersect the x-axis on the _real plane._

So to solve this issue, we need to _expand_ our vision of numbers: maybe we can find a specific field whose numbers can have negative squares.
