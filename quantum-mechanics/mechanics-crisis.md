# Mechanics Crisis

Through the first years of the 20th century classical mechanics encountered a crisis which made all the theoretical beleaf fall appart: some important experiments were giving results that not in accordance with classical theory. So, in order to explain these phenomena, a new theory had to be laid: *Quantum Mechanics*.

To start the course, we must understand which were the problems and their solutions that lead to *QM*, starting with quantization of energy.
